# FewRel Dataset, Toolkits and Baseline Models

FewRel is a large-scale few-shot relation extraction dataset, which contains 70000 natural language sentences expressing 100 different relations. This dataset is presented in the our EMNLP 2018 paper [FewRel: A Large-Scale Few-Shot Relation Classification Dataset with State-of-the-Art Evaluation](https://github.com/ProKil/FewRel/blob/master/paper/fewrel.pdf).

## Contributions

Hao Zhu first proposed this problem and proposed the way to build the dataset and the baseline system; Ziyuan Wang built and maintained the crowdsourcing website; Yuan Yao helped download the original data and conducted preprocess; 
Xu Han, Hao Zhu, Pengfei Yu and Ziyun Wang implemented baselines and wrote the paper together; Zhiyuan Liu provided thoughtful advice and funds through the whole project. The order of the first four authors are determined by dice rolling.
